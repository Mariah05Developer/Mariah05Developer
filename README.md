- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mariah05Developer
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multiple languages at a time. I have learned and dabbled in Python, Java, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and C. My first langauge I learned was Visual basic which
- made it easier to grasp the others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and be able to learn more and have exposure to extensive repositories.
- 📫 How to reach me by my email ( mariahjacksoncybersweep@gmai.com ) 
- 😄 Pronouns:  She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am left handed and my favorite color is purple
